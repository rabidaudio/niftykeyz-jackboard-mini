An alternative jack board for the [Cre8audio NiftyKeyz modular keyboard](https://www.cre8audio.com/niftykeyz).

The original sits too far into the case, taking space away from the modules.
This one shrinks the width as much as possible, and causes the jacks to sit a
few extra millimeters out of the back of the case.

Flat flex connector: [HLW10S-2C7LF](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/amphenol-icc-fci/hlw10s-2c7lf/1002138)
